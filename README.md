# social_travel_site
This website will be a photo sharing and blog site for people to connect and share the locations they have traveled to. Each location a user has traveled to will be be added to their "map." Each location will be a pin on the user's map for others to see. Each pin will be associated with a photo or a blog post. Each user will have their posts on a map at the top of their homepage followed by all their posts.
